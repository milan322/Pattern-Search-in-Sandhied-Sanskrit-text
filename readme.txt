     Application Functionalites:
       -->This app takes two inputs:
           *The sanskrit sandhied text.
           *Pattern to search.
           
        Example: Sandhied Sanskrit text:  अत्र शऊरआ महएष्वआसआ भईमआर्जउनसमआ यउधइ

                  Pattern to search is:  महेष
                   
                   So the application will compare the pattern in the sansdhied text if it will find 
                   the match then it will highlight the matched pattern in the sandhied sanskrit string.
